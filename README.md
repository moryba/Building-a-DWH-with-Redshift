# Building a DWH with Redshift - Udacity Data Engineer Nanodegree Program 

## Project Introduction

A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database and want to move their processes and data onto the cloud. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

## Project Description

My task is to build an ETL pipeline that extracts  data from S3, stages them in Redshift, and transforms data into a set of dimensional tables for the analytics team to continue finding insights in what songs the users are listening to. 

## Goal of the Project

The goal is to load data from S3 to staging tables on Redshift and execute SQL statements that create the analytics tables from the staging tables.

## S3 Data Source

- Song data: s3://udacity-dend/song_data
- Log data: s3://udacity-dend/log_data

Log data json path: s3://udacity-dend/log_json_path.json

## Explanation of the datasets

Song Dataset: it is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. 

Example of song dataset: {"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}

Log Dataset: it consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate app activity logs from an imaginary music streaming app based on configuration settings. The log files in the dataset are partitioned by year and month.

## Explanation of the files in the repository

- sql_queries.py : it contains all the queries to drop the existing tables and create new tables 
- create_tables.py: it involves all the functions like drop_table, create_table and main. The aim is to trigger the contents in the sql_queries.py
- etl.py: this file permits to load data from s3 to staging tables and insert values in the tables created


## Schema for Song Play Analysis

- Fact Table:

    songplays - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong
    (songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent)

- Dimension Tables:

    users - users in the app (user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level)
    songs - songs in music database (song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration)
    artists - artists in music database (artist_id, name, location, latitude, longitude)    
    time - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units (start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday)

## How to run the program 

Steps to run the program:

    - Create the IAM User
    - Create and set the Redshift DB
    - Configure the program with the dwh.cfg
    - Run create_tables.py
    - Run the etl.py
